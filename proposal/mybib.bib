	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524},
	abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical {PASCAL} {VOC} dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision ({mAP}) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on {VOC} 2012---achieving a {mAP} of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with {CNNs}, we call our method R-{CNN}: Regions with {CNN} features. We also compare R-{CNN} to {OverFeat}, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar {CNN} architecture. We find that R-{CNN} outperforms {OverFeat} by a large margin on the 200-class {ILSVRC}2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}rbg/rcnn.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for {ILSVRC}14 is called {GoogLeNet}, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classiﬁcation and detection.},

It has been used in many recognition tasks including handwritten digits, Chinese words and trafﬁc signs, etc. However, training and test {DNN} are time-consuming tasks. In practical vehicle detection application, both speed and accuracy are required. So increasing the speeds of {DNN} while keeping its high accuracy has signiﬁcant meaning for many recognition and detection applications. We introduce parallel branches into the {DNN}. The maps of the layers of {DNN} are divided into several parallel branches, each branch has the same number of maps. There are not direct connections between different branches. Our parallel {DNN} ({PNN}) keeps the same structure and dimensions of the {DNN}, reducing the total number of connections between maps. The more number of branches we divide, the more swift the speed of the {PNN} is, the conventional {DNN} becomes a special form of {PNN} which has only one branch. Experiments on large vehicle database showed that the detection accuracy of {PNN} dropped slightly with the speed increasing. Even the fastest {PNN} (10 times faster than {DNN}), whose branch has only two maps, fully outperformed the traditional methods based on features (such as {HOG}, {LBP}). In fact, {PNN} provides a good solution way for compromising the speed and accuracy requirements in many applications.},

	abstract = {With the launch of various remote-sensing satellites, more and more high-spatial resolution remote-sensing ({HSR}-{RS}) images are becoming available. Scene classiﬁcation of such a huge volume of {HSR}-{RS} images is a big challenge for the eﬃciency of the feature learning and model training. The deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}), a typical deep learning model, is an eﬃcient end-toend deep hierarchical feature learning model that can capture the intrinsic features of input {HSR}-{RS} images. However, most published {CNN} architectures are borrowed from natural scene classiﬁcation with thousands of training samples, and they are not designed for {HSR}-{RS} images. In this paper, we propose an agile {CNN} architecture, named as {SatCNN}, for {HSR}-{RS} image scene classiﬁcation. Based on recent improvements to modern {CNN} architectures, we use more eﬃcient convolutional layers with smaller kernels to build an eﬀective {CNN} architecture. Experiments on {SAT} data sets conﬁrmed that {SatCNN} can quickly and eﬀectively learn robust features to handle the intra-class diversity even with small convolutional kernels, and the deeper convolutional layers allow spontaneous modelling of the relative spatial relationships. With the help of fast graphics processing unit acceleration, {SatCNN} can be trained within about 40 min, achieving overall accuracies of 99.65\% and 99.54\%, which is the state-ofthe-art for {SAT} data sets.},

	abstract = {Reliable ship detection plays an important role in both military and civil ﬁelds. However, it makes the task difﬁcult with high-resolution remote sensing images with complex background and various types of ships with different poses, shapes and scales. Related works mostly used gray and shape features to detect ships, which obtain results with poor robustness and efﬁciency. To detect ships more automatically and robustly, we propose a novel ship detection method based on the convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}), called {SCNN}, fed with speciﬁcally designed proposals extracted from the ship model combined with an improved saliency detection method. Firstly we creatively propose two ship models, the “V” ship head model and the “{\textbar}{\textbar}” ship body one, to localize the ship proposals from the line segments extracted from a test image. Next, for offshore ships with relatively small sizes, which cannot be efﬁciently picked out by the ship models due to the lack of reliable line segments, we propose an improved saliency detection method to ﬁnd these proposals. Therefore, these two kinds of ship proposals are fed to the trained {CNN} for robust and efﬁcient detection. Experimental results on a large amount of representative remote sensing images with different kinds of ships with varied poses, shapes and scales demonstrate the efﬁciency and robustness of our proposed S-{CNN}-Based ship detector.},

	abstract = {There is a series of earth observation satellites called Landsat, which send a very large amount of image data every day such that it is hard to analyze manually. Thus an eﬀective application of machine learning techniques to automatically analyze such data is called for. In surface object recognition, which is one of the important applications of such data, the distribution of a speciﬁc object on the surface is surveyed. In this paper, we propose and compare two methods for surface object recognition, one using the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and the other support vector machine ({SVM}). In our experiments, {CNN} showed higher performance than {SVM}. In addition, we observed that the number of negative samples have a inﬂuence on the performance, and it is necessary to select the number of them for practical use.},
